# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-Minimax-Implementation
This Python project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering both single-player (against the AI) and multiplayer modes. It employs the Minimax algorithm, a powerful decision-making technique in artificial intelligence, to make strategic moves on behalf of the computer opponent in single-player mode.
