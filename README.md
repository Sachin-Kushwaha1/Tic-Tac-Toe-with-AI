# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI

## Python
This Python project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering both single-player (against the AI) and multiplayer modes. It employs the Minimax algorithm, a powerful decision-making technique in artificial intelligence, to make strategic moves on behalf of the computer opponent in single-player mode.

## C++

This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It features both single-player (with an AI opponent) and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can choose to play as either "X" or "O," and the AI will play against them.
