# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI

## Python
This Python project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, offering both single-player (against the AI) and multiplayer modes. It employs the Minimax algorithm, a powerful decision-making technique in artificial intelligence, to make strategic moves on behalf of the computer opponent in single-player mode.

## C++

This project is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It features both single-player (with an AI opponent) and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can choose to play as either "X" or "O," and the AI will play against them.

## How to Play
1. On startup, choose:
   - `1` for **Single-Player** mode.
   - `2` for **Multiplayer** mode.
2. In Single-Player mode, decide whether to play as **X** or **O**.
3. Players take turns to mark a position (1-9) on a 3x3 grid:
   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```
4. The first player to align 3 of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If the grid is full without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
